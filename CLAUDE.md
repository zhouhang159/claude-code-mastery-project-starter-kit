## Critical Rules

### 0. NEVER Publish Sensitive Data

- NEVER commit passwords, API keys, tokens, or secrets to git/npm/docker
- NEVER commit `.env` files — ALWAYS verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- Before ANY commit: verify no secrets are included
- NEVER output secrets in suggestions, logs, or responses

### 1. TypeScript Always

- ALWAYS use TypeScript for new files (strict mode)
- NEVER use `any` unless absolutely necessary and documented why
- When editing JavaScript files, convert to TypeScript first
- Types are specs — they tell you what functions accept and return

### 2. API Versioning

```
CORRECT: /api/v1/users
WRONG:   /api/users
```

Every API endpoint MUST use `/api/v1/` prefix. No exceptions.

### 3. Database Access — Wrapper Only

- NEVER create direct database connections outside `src/core/db/`
- ALWAYS use the centralized database wrapper
- NEVER create new client instances (MongoClient, PrismaClient, etc.)
- One connection pool. One place to change. One place to mock.

### 4. Testing — Explicit Success Criteria

- ALWAYS define explicit success criteria for E2E tests
- "Page loads" is NOT a success criterion
- Every test MUST verify: URL, visible elements, data displayed
- NEVER write tests without assertions

```typescript
// CORRECT — explicit success criteria
await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Welcome');

// WRONG — passes even if broken
await page.goto('/dashboard');
// no assertion!
```

### 5. NEVER Hardcode Credentials

- ALWAYS use environment variables for secrets
- NEVER put API keys, passwords, or tokens directly in code
- NEVER hardcode connection strings — use DATABASE_URL from .env

### 6. ALWAYS Ask Before Deploying

- NEVER auto-deploy, even if the fix seems simple
- NEVER assume approval — wait for explicit "yes, deploy"
- ALWAYS ask before deploying to production

### 7. Quality Gates

- No file > 300 lines (split if larger)
- No function > 50 lines (extract helper functions)
- All tests must pass before committing
- TypeScript must compile with no errors (`tsc --noEmit`)

### 8. Parallelize Independent Awaits

- When multiple `await` calls are independent (none depends on another's result), ALWAYS use `Promise.all`
- NEVER await independent operations sequentially — it wastes time
- Before writing sequential awaits, evaluate: does the second call need the first call's result?

```typescript
// CORRECT — independent operations run in parallel
const [users, products, orders] = await Promise.all([
  getUsers(),
  getProducts(),
  getOrders(),
]);

// WRONG — sequential when they don't depend on each other
const users = await getUsers();
const products = await getProducts();  // waits for users unnecessarily
const orders = await getOrders();      // waits for products unnecessarily
```

```typescript
// CORRECT — sequential when there IS a dependency
const user = await getUserById(id);
const orders = await getOrdersByUserId(user.id); // needs user.id
```

---

## When Something Seems Wrong

Before jumping to conclusions:

- Missing UI element? → Check feature gates BEFORE assuming bug
- Empty data? → Check if services are running BEFORE assuming broken
- 404 error? → Check service separation BEFORE adding endpoint
- Auth failing? → Check which auth system BEFORE debugging
- Test failing? → Read the error message fully BEFORE changing code

---

## Service Ports (FIXED — NEVER CHANGE)

| Service | Dev Port | Test Port | URL |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----|
| Website | 3000 | 4000 | http://localhost:{port} |
| API | 3001 | 4010 | http://localhost:{port} |
| Dashboard | 3002 | 4020 | http://localhost:{port} |

When starting any service, ALWAYS use its assigned port:

```bash
# CORRECT
npx next dev -p 3002

# WRONG — never let it default
npx next dev
```

Before starting services, ALWAYS kill existing processes on those ports:

```bash
lsof -ti:3000,3001,3002 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
```

## Project Documentation

| Document | Purpose | When to Read |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `project-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System overview & data flow | Before architectural changes |
| `project-docs/INFRASTRUCTURE.md` | Deployment details | Before environment changes |
| `project-docs/DECISIONS.md` | Architectural decisions | Before proposing alternatives |

**ALWAYS read relevant docs before making cross-service changes.**

---

## Coding Standards

### Imports

```typescript
// CORRECT — explicit, typed
import { getUserById } from './handlers/users.js';
import type { User } from './types/index.js';

// WRONG — barrel imports that pull everything
import * as everything from './index.js';
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
// CORRECT — handle errors explicitly
try {
  const user = await getUserById(id);
  if (!user) throw new NotFoundError('User not found');
  return user;
} catch (err) {
  logger.error('Failed to get user', { id, error: err });
  throw err;
}

// WRONG — swallow errors silently
try {
  return await getUserById(id);
} catch {
  return null; // silent failure
}
```

## Naming — NEVER Rename Mid-Project

Renaming packages, modules, or key variables mid-project causes cascading failures that are extremely hard to catch. If you must rename:

1. Create a checklist of ALL files and references first
2. Use IDE semantic rename (not search-and-replace)
3. Full project search for old name after renaming
4. Check: .md files, .txt files, .env files, comments, strings, paths
5. Start a FRESH Claude session after renaming

---

## Plan Mode — Watch for Contradictions

When modifying a plan:

- Use EXACT step names: "Replace Step 3 (Database Selection): Use Redis"
- NEVER just append: "Also, use Redis instead" ← causes contradictions
- After any plan change, review the FULL plan for conflicting steps
- If fundamentally changing direction: `/clear` → state requirements fresh

---

## Documentation Sync

When updating any feature, keep these locations in sync:

1. `README.md` (repository root)
2. `project-docs/` (relevant documentation)
3. Inline code comments
4. Test descriptions

If you update one, update ALL.

---

## Workflow Preferences

- Quality over speed — if unsure, ask before executing
- One task, one chat — `/clear` between unrelated tasks
- Use `/context` to check token usage when working on large tasks
- When testing: queue observations, fix in batch (not one at a time)
- Research shows 2% misalignment early in a conversation can cause 40% failure rate by end — start fresh when changing direction
- Use sub-agents for research mid-task to avoid polluting main context
