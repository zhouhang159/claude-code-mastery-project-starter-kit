## Reporting Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](../../issues). Include:
- Claude Code version (`claude --version`)
- OS and environment (macOS, Linux, WSL2)

- Expected vs actual behavior

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch from `main` (`git checkout -b feat/your-change`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass
5. Run the `/review` slash command in Claude Code on every file you changed
6. Open a PR against `main`

## What's Welcome

- New skills (`.claude/skills/`)

## What's NOT Welcome

- Framework-specific opinions — keep it stack-agnostic where possible
- Removing existing rules without discussion — open an issue first
- Large refactors without a prior issue/discussion

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode for all new files
- Follow the existing patterns in the project
- No file > 300 lines, no function > 50 lines
- Run `/review` before submitting your PR
- See `CLAUDE.md` for the full coding standards
